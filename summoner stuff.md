# Summoner

Furrowing his brow in concentration, the old elf surveys the hectic battle around him, commanding a small swarm of elementals to take down the horde of goblins and helping a downed party member to their feet.

Whispering an incantation under her breath, the young human calls a snarling beast of shadow to her side, stopping her assailants in their tracks.

### Creating a Summoner

(Need words here)

#### Quickbuild

You can make a summoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the Sage background.

## Class Features

As a summoner, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

---

- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per summoner level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per summoner level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

---

- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
- **Tools:** None
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Constitution
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- _(a)_ a light crossbow and 20 bolts or _(b)_ any simple weapon
- _(a)_ a component pouch or _(b)_ an arcane focus
- _(a)_ a scholar’s pack or _(b)_ an explorer’s pack
- _(a)_ two daggers

### Summon Visitant

You are able to summon a creature originating from another plane called a visitant. Your visitant is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. You can summon your visitant through a ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform, or as an action using a 1st level spell slot or higher. As you level up your visitant levels with you, gaining more health and abilities. As an action, you can dismiss your visitant and send it back to to its original plane where it
\page
awaits your summons. In combat your visitant shares your initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours. You can command what actions the visitant takes at no cost to you. If you fall unconscious your visitant is immediately sent back its original plane and cannot be re-summoned until after you take a long test.

While your visitant is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your visitant's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any Special Senses that your visitant has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own Senses.

#### Core Forms

Your visitant's physical appearance is based off of one of five core forms. These core forms offer varying starting stats and a starting adaption. This adaption is always known and does not count against your number of available known adaptions. You can change your visitant's core form when you gain a Major Adaption point increase.

#### Starting Stats

Your ability score is determined the same way as a player character. Refer to Chapter 1 of the _Player's Handbook_ to read how to determine Ability Scores.

#### Proficiencies

---

- **Saving Throws:** Charisma, Strength
- **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Performance, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival.

#### Hit Points and Healing

Based on the core form of your visitant the Hit Die will vary. The hit die of your visitant's core form is found in the Core Form section at the end of this class description.

---

- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** Hit Die + Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** Hit Die / 2, rounded up + Constitution modifier per summoner level after 1st

Because of the distant point of origin of your visitant those not familiar with the planes cannot heal your visitant. Only a character with the Summon Visitant ability can restore hit points to a visitant. As an action you can touch a visitant that is friendly to you and expend a spell slot, the visitant regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 x the spell slot expended + your spellcasting ability modifier. A visitant cannot take a rest on its own and only benefits from a rest only when the its summoner rests. Likewise, If the visitant is not on its original plane of existence its summoner cannot gain the benefits of a rest unless the visitant is resting too. If the visitant is on its home plane and the summoner rests the visitant also does gain the benefits of the rest.

<p class='indent'>
When your visitant drops to 0 Hit Points it is sent back to its original plane, leaving behind no physical form. When returned to its original plane it instantly regains all hit points but cannot be summoned again until you finish a long rest since your connection has been severed. If your visitant is on its original plane when it drops to 0 hit points it makes death saving throws as normal.</p>

```

```

#### Natural Attacks

Your visitant has a natural weapon attack which does either slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage based on how the attack is performed. If your visitant attacks with its claws, or talons it may do slashing damage, or if it attacks with its fangs, teeth, or barbed tail it might do piercing damage, if it slams its body against a creature or strikes with an appendage it might do bludgeoning, or it might do something else entirely and is at the discretion of the DM. The damage die is found in the Core Form section at the end of this class description.

### Arcane Connection

When you cast a spell with the range of _self_, and your visitant is within 5 feet of you during the casting of the spell, you can choose to have the spell effect to target you or your visitant. If you choose to have the spell effect your visitant the spell utilizes the casting time as normal of your turn and your visitant's action to deliver the spell.

If the spell does not requires you to make an attack roll, or an enemy to make a saving throw during the casting of the spell you can choose the have the spell effect apply to both you and your visitant. If the spell requires concentration it will utilize your concentration to apply the spell effect to all effected creatures.

For example, when you cast Dispel Evil and Good and your visitant is within 5 feet of you you can choose for the spell effect to apply to both you and your visitant since the spell does not require a saving throw while it is being cast. Alternatively, when you cast Green Flame Blade and your visitant is within 5 feet of you you can choose for you or your visitant to make the attack weapon attack since the spell requires an attack roll during the casting time. If you choose for your visitant deliver the spell this will use your action to cast the spell and your visitant's action to deliver the spell with an attack.

### Visitant Adaptions

At 1st level you choose a core form for your visitant which has a starting adaption known and one additional adaption of your choice. Your visitant always has this starting adaption known, and it doesn't count against the adaptions your visitant has known. When you summon your visitant you choose which of the known adaptions are active. The number of adaptions your visitant has known increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the known adaptions column of the Summoner table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the adaptions known to your visitant and replace it with another adaption that you could learn at that level. The adaptions are listed at the end of this class description.

### Spellcasting

You've studied The Planes of Existence and learned to manipulate their energies to your whim. This knowledge of the workings of the multiverse powers your spells. See chapter 10 in the _Player's Handbook_ for the general rules of spellcasting.

\page

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the summoner spell list. You learn additional summoner cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Summoner table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the summoner cantrips you know with another cantrip from the summoner spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Summoner table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your summoner spells. To cast one of your summoner spells of 1st level or higher,you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots after finishing a long rest.

You prepare the list of summoner spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the summoner spell list. When you do so, choose a number of summoner spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your summoner level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level summoner, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells after finishing a long rest. Preparing a new list o f summoner spells requires time spent connecting to the inner and outer planes of the multiverse: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your summoner spells. The power of your spells comes from your connection to planar energy. You use your Intelligence whenever a summoner spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a summoner spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">
***Spell save DC*** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**_Spell attack modifier_** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

  </div>

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a summoner spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the _Player's Handbook_) as a spellcasting focus for your summoner spells.

```

```

### Planar Connection

Choose one plane that is largest source of you and your visitant's power: Plane of Fire, Swamp of Oblivion, and Feywild all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level when you choose it and additional benefits at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 14th level.

### Visitant Major Adaption

At 2nd level you learn your 1st major adaption. When you summon your visitant you choose which of the known major adaptions are active. The number of major adaptions your visitant has known increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the known major adaptions column of the Summoner table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the major adaptions known to your visitant and replace it with another major adaption that you could learn at that level. The major adaptions are listed at the end of this class description.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Pass Between

Starting at 5th level, your ability to manipulate the planes enables you and your visitant to jump between the planes in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn you can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Additionally, as a bonus action on your visitant's turn it can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Alternatively, you can use your connection as an anchor and increase the distance. If you and your visitant are in line of site of one another the distance is increased to 120 feet but can only appear in a vacant square adjacent to one another. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Starting at 10th the range you can teleport increases to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and the distance when using one another as an anchor increases to 320 feet.

### Planar Strike

Starting at 6th level, your visitant's natural weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Life Link

Starting at 10th level, your bond between your visitant has linked your life forces together and can share your health between each other. When your visitant takes damage you can choose to have any amount of that damage to come out of your current hit points instead, as a reaction.

If the damage to your visitant would cause it to make a concentration check it makes the concentration check off of the total damage it would have received.

\page

<p class='indent'>

If the damage to you would cause you to make a concentration check you makes the concentration check off of the total damage you would have received.
	</p>

### Shared Adaption

Starting at 10th level, your connection with your visitant has altered your very existence. When you finish a long rest you can choose one of your known visitant adaptions and one of your known major adaptions and activate them on yourself gaining the effects, your visitant can still have these adaptions active. You must meet all the requirements of these adaption to activate them on yourself.

Starting at 14th level, your study of the other planes has allowed you to peer between them. You can see into the Ethereal Plane out to a range of 120 feet.

### Plane Shift

Starting at 19th level you gain the manipulate the connections between the planes at ease. As an action you can cast the Plane Shift spell without expending a spell slot.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Twin Souls

Starting at 20th level your bond with your visitant is complete. As an action you can assume the shape of your visitant for 1 minute, copying all of its adaptions, form, and abilities. You can use this feature once and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. You can choose to end this early using an action. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form.

## Planar Connection

### Fire Plane

Your keen interest in the planes has found its deepest connection with the plane of fire. Often, summoners with this connection have had an affinity towards fire or light their entire lives and this fascination has led them to finding ways of bringing a touch of flame into their magic. Your visitant might takes on a fiery aspect of some sort whether that be a soothing scent of a campfire, ember red fur that dances even with no wind present.

#### Fire Plane Spells

<div class='prereq'>
1st-level Fire Plane feature
</div>

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Fire Plane Spells table. These spells count as summoner spells for you, but they don't count against the number of summoner spells you known.

```

```

##### Fire Plane Spells

#### Fiery Origin

<div class='prereq'>
1st-level Fire Plane feature
</div>

Your visitant comes from the ever-burning plane of fire and feels at home amongst the flames. Your visitant is immune to fire damage and resistence to cold damage but for every 5 ft. it moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage. Additionally, you gain resistence to fire damage.

#### Burning Core

<div class='prereq'>
3rd-level Fire Plane feature
</div>

Because of your visitant's fiery origins it can bring light and warmth to those around it. As an action your visitant can ignite their very being bringing pieces of the fire plane to those around it. While this feature is active your visitant sheds bright light out ot a range of 30 feet and dim light out to a range of 60 feet. Additionally, any creatures within 10 feet of your visitant, including itself, don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

<div></div>

#### Soul Tinder

<div class='prereq'>

Your visitant must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

<h5>Keen Senses</h5>
You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell and hearing.

<h5>Keen Sight</h5>
You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

<h5>Helpful</h5>
When your visitant uses the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of it, rather than within 5 feet of it, if the target can see or hear it.

<h5>Menacing Presence</h5>
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be frightened by you in this way for 1 hour.

<h5>Mimicry</h5>
Your visitant can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by their Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.

<h5>Pounce</h5>
If your visitant moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee weapon attack attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.

<h5>Sure-Footed</h5>
You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.

<h5>Telepathic Bond</h5>
  <div class='prereq'> 
Prerequisite: 5th Level 
</div>
While the visitant is on the same plane of existence as its summoner, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically.

<h5>Thick Hide</h5>
You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. You can select this adaption the number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

<h5>Well Trained</h5>
You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. Alternatively, you can choose one skill in which you already have proficiency and gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus. You can select this adaption multiple times.
